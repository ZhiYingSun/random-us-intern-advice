### On paperwork & embassy interview
* get your paperwork in ASAP! There might be delays if you require an embassy interview in Toronto! 
* also if there are no dates available for the embassy interview, you should request for an EXPEDITED interview!
* You can't bring your phones into the embassy, but there is a convenient store down the street where you can store your stuff!


### Getting your SSN
* you should try to call your local SSA office and ask if they do a walk-in or appointments
* if you call SSA, you will get a referral which might take a week to get back to you
* you can find the number for your local SSA office when you call SSA, if you cannot find it online


### Money and Banking
* you should try to open a debit account when you get to the US and try to apply for a credit card whenever you can
* If you have a little over $1000 on hand, you can get a credit card approved the next day at Bank of America (consult your branch)


### misc.
* don't arrive too early, anywhere around noon should be good. 
* If you have an airbnb, be mindful of the check-in time.
